# Infoverse AI

## Description

This project provides visual interfaces to interact with the vast knowledge base of Wikidata. In addition to utilizing the linear form of information presentation that is common on Wikidata, this project provides many non-linear visual aids to present and interact with the information on Wikidata such as:

- A graph visualization of the Wikidata knowledge base.
- A map visualization of the Wikidata knowledge base.
- A timeline visualization of the Wikidata knowledge base.
- A collapsible interactive tree visualization of the Wikidata knowledge base.
- A list of common Wikidata items.
- A list of common Wikidata properties.
- A list of common Wikidata statements.

### The Problem

One of the main challenges with accessing the data in the hyperlink and linear form of pages that link to other pages is that of exploration on a high level. This form of information exploration is similar to exploring a vast physical landscape on-foot, with trees or tall grass allowing you to only see right in-front of where you are. This is in-contrast to the bird in-flight able to see the sprawling landscape, while missing the details of the landscape due to the covering trees or other plant life.

### The Solution

The solution to this problem is to provide a variety of visual aids to allow the user to explore the information on Wikidata in a non-linear fashion. This allows the user to see the landscape in a more holistic fashion, while still being able to zoom in on the details of the information landscape.

## What is Wikidata

Wikidata is a vast bank of structured information that is free and open to any user on the internet. The Wikidata knowledge base is the central storage for structured data that all Wikimedia Foundation projects (such as Wikipedia.org) utilize.
